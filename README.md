# ECE470_ChicagoBlackBox
This is the repository for the ECE 470 Group Project of the Chicago BlackBox (Adam Rosales, Dan Panno, Fangyu Qian)

This repository (as of October 13, 2021) represents the current progress of the team towards the semester project up to the Project Update 1 checkpoint.

Currently, the catkin_ws file represents the work the team has done to learn the process of editing URDF models, learning proper structure of .launch files, integrating movement with the MoveIt plugin, taking sensor data with the SensorPlugin, and demo scripts.

This work was learned with the help of a variety of tutorials and instruction sets provided online by a variety of sources.

Further work will integrate what was learned for this project update towards building our own fully custom environment and robot for the final project.
